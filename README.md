# Project: Visual Attention Neurofeedback Platorm

The setup is able to synchronously collect behavioral, neural, and any other LSL-compatible neurophysiological signals.
The setup can be extended to synchronously collect other types of behavioral and physiological signals (Heart rate, saccade, GSR, etc.).

The setup is developed by:\
Soheil Borhani, sborhani at vols.utk.edu\
Michael O'neil, moneil8 at vols.utk.edu

This is achieved in collaboration with:\
Zhao's Nonlinear Biodynamics lab, University of Tennessee, Knoxville\
Jiang's ABC lab, University of Kentucky, Lexington


## Installation
The setup is generally OS-independent. However, the below instruction is for Windows 10.


1. Install standalone PsychoPy. 
The setup should be compatible with the latest version of PsychoPy. You can download it from [this](https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy/releases) link. Although the setup may work properly on python 2.7, I recommend using standalone PsychoPy with python 3.



2. Install pylsl for recording labstreaminglayer (LSL) streams.
LSL is a gold-standard for synchronous neurophysiological data collection and this platform is designed in a way that supports data collection using LSL protocol. Using LSL at the core of the setup makes it universal and vendor-independent.

> You may need administrator privilege for installing the package. Assuming installation of PsychoPy in default route, you can install pylsl using this command:
```windows
C:\Program Files (x86)\PsychoPy3>python -m pip install pylsl
```



3. Install (win)pexpect for seamlessly start and stop LSL data recording.
LabRecorder collects neurophysiological signal streams in LSL seamlessly in the background. We need (win)pexpect library to call LabRecorder.

```windows
C:\Program Files (x86)\PsychoPy3>python -m pip install winpexpect
```



4. Install xlrd for reading stimuli excel file.
The setup presented a pseudo-random sequence of stimuli to the participants. The specifics of the stimuli is coded in multiple excel files. The setup requires xlrd python library to call and access to the excel files.

```windows
C:\Program Files (x86)\PsychoPy3>python -m pip install xlrd
```

## Recording File Format
LabRecorder record into the XDF file format (Extensible Data Format, hosted at https://github.com/sccn/xdf). XDF was designed concurrently with the lab streaming layer and supports the full feature set of LSL (including multi-stream container files, per-stream arbitrarily large XML headers, all sample formats as well as time-synchronization information).
